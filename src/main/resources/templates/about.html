		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart Contact Manager was created with aim of managing contacts of large number of people easily.  This application is useful for companies or industries or also for local people to keep track of their contact list.  Our purpose is to provide platform to people secured with their username and password. New Users have to first register to application and then they can login with their credentials. 
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are providing facility to consumer to add new contacts by specifying name, email, contact number, their specific information or any file if needed. There is also a seperate page to view contacts we added. On the same page we are providing facility to consumer to update information. If consumer dont want any of the entry in their list, they can also delete that particular contact. Every user logged in to our application will have profile created. Also, there is facility provided to change password in settings tab for logged in users.</h3>
